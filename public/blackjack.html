                Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the dealer. The goal is to get a hand total
                closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over 21. Here are the basic rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.</li>
                <li>Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable.</li>
                <li>Players are dealt two cards initially.</li>
                <li>Players can choose to "hit" to receive another card, or "stand" to stop receiving cards.</li>
                <li>If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they bust and lose the game.</li>
                <li>The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or more.</li>
                <li>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it's a push.
                </li>
            </ul>
